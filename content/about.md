Hi I'm an illustrator / concept artist. I am both capable of 2D and 3D drawings but my preference goes out to 2D.

I've been passionate about art and drawing since I was little. In 2021 I graduated as a concept artist and have been expanding my portfolio ever since. On this portfolio website you can catch a glimpse of it.
